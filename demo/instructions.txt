In this experiment, you will see a series of nouns describing 
common physical objects or entitities.  For 
each word, you should decide whether the word is man-made 
or natural.  If the object is man-made, hit the "Z" key on the 
lower left part of the keyboard.  If the object occurs naturually, 
hit the "/" key on the lower right part of the keyboard.  Respond as 
accurately and as quickly as possible.  We will start with a few 
practice items.\n  Press the "X" key to begin.
