todo:

- we seem to get unknown feedback if you use a variable that hasn't
  been defined????

-allow if() statements to be empty.

- itemorder test uses Z/Zed; change to length 7???

-  line wrapping: when the last token in a string is too long to fit
   on a line and it is wrapped to the next line, it takes the previous
   token along with it.

 - add reporting for TOL of additional statistics.
 - Add a FileExists() function???
 - Add a Dir() functions???

 -automatic subject code/experiment name logging?
 - Make/document various layout functions
 - Make a function that unloads the window but keeps running the PEBL.


-syntax _should_ handle, shouldn't it?:
}
else
{

- Print("") a message in test batteries about where data is saved.  Maybe link that to FileClose()?


- file concatenation function (appendfile?).

- streams of experiments  **done

- FileExists() to test whether a file is there**node

- WaitForAnyKeyPressForTimeout doesn't work.

 - save clock test to file + instructions (it may already exist?)

-EasyLabel crashes silently without feedback if window is given as the
 second argument??? ***fixed

- makeImage will load a non-graphics file happily, but segfault
