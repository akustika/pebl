todo:

* Hide() (and presumably show) Crashes when parameter is text (not a widget).
* width and height parameters no longer working on lines (see shapes.pbl)
* .zoomx and .zoomy are not printed out in the printproperties
* .zoomx and .zoomy mess up the location of the image--it should keep
   at the same center, but it does not.
* Do something about quotes.
