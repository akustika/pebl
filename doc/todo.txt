update/ Document how  the last parameter of MakeFont(), if set to 0,
is now rendered smoothly using alpha transparency.  Before it was
blocky. Using this allows one to make a font label with a transparent
background.  In that case, bgcol is ignored.

- MakeColorRGBA doesn't work.  Is this even a funcion? No, just MakeColorRGB.

-still get a segfault on capturesignal in gabor.pbl.  Maybe 
 children aren't getting properly removed?

- Update versions of fonts we distribute (especially vera.ttf) *Added Dejavu.
- Make gPEBLFONT point to Vera.ttf, and force all auto functions to 
  use it.  *Done; changed to DejaVu.
