========================================
To Do for 0.13:

- Seems to be a problem with setting x/y location of images that are scaled?
   (cannot replicate.)

- determine whether secret abort code works on italian keyboards.
   (fixed...)

- document what happens when lookup doesn't find a match.

- be sure to fix keypad entry on digit span; probably fixed for 3001; see Marco Moniz email.  ***Fixed.

- New trail test (Salthouse's one). **Completed.

-Document transition from list to vector; access to lists via [] not yet possible.

Transpose seems to give a wrong answer for Transpose([[1,2]]), Which I think should be [[1],[2]]  FIXED--it does give this answer.

- PrintProperties only works on widgets; shuold work on all objects. (it should work on network objects and ports etc.)

- Loading/reloading sound files that are mono crashes on the conversion. (See ann gilman's bug--document this???)

-launcher should work on 1024x600 screen (small screen works)

- Improved Debian Packaging.
- debian makefile stuff.
- Incorporate documentation in makefile.

EasyLabel can't accept a number in the text variable. Maybe it should?
  --fixed: autoconvert to numbers, but send a warning in case things go awry.

- Perseveration stuff in BCST. (data script is fixed...may not be ready?)

  -possibly, do checking for screen size under fullscreen mode.

 - Fix cr/lf in windows battery files. (mostly fixed)

  - Have consistent solution to getting subject code in battery tests. (mostly fixed)

 - fix shuffling problem in BCST  ????

- Function that determines current screen size. ****Done



 - for battery, fix gsubnum stuff and screen resolution stuff. (Mostly fixed)

 - move GetEasychoice to libs; remove from battery tests that use it. ****DONE

 - Allow Shuffle to take multiple arguments, which are shuffled in parallel??? (Not done)

 - Create a PushOn type function (DONE)

- look at layout functions in multichoice batter test to incorporate as full function. (now in ebbinghaus and multichoice for testing; need work there).

- WaitForAnyKeyPressWithTimeout doesn't work.

-Solve CJK font issue (replace firefly and the other one??)

-ANT test problems (crashes in 0.12) ***FIXED
-TOL test problems (crasher w/too long lists) ***Fixed
-TOH--slowdown with trials (TOH TOO?). ***Fixed for TOH

 -Document Parallel port functions
   -consider changing getstate function to return list of 0/1

 -Document serial port functions

 -Krystal's bug in TOH

 -document WaitForClickOnTargetWithTimeout, remove from battery tests
 -document CountDown(), remove from battery tests.
- document Match(), Filter(), and Levels()

- Document GetCurrentScreenResolution and GetVideoModes()

- document RemoveFile(), changes to FileOpenWrite()

- improve  recursion stuff. (Not done)

--------------------------------------------
##Completed for 0.12

- File selector: 
                 Add a +1 button to subject code? ***Done

- we seem to get unknown feedback if you use a variable that hasn't
  been defined???? (probably the stderr problem) ***



-  line wrapping: when the last token in a string is too long to fit
   on a line and it is wrapped to the next line, it takes the previous
   token along with it.  --***done

 - Add a FileExists() function??? ***done

 - Add a Dir() functions???  ***done (GetDirectoryListing()

 - Document Joystick Functions **Done


 -fix problem where clicking outside box will lose focus and finish
  input (should be an option) ***done

 -automatic subject code/experiment name logging? **Done in fileselect

 - Make/document various layout functions **Done



- file concatenation function (appendfile?).  **Done

- streams of experiments  **done

- FileExists() to test whether a file is there**done


 - save clock test to file + instructions (it may already exist?) **Done

-EasyLabel crashes silently without feedback if window is given as the
 second argument??? ***fixed


- allow the strings to be translated in the launcher (and possibly
  elsewhere?) ***done


=============================================
Push to 0.13 or Later

getText seems not to work on labels

 - Let lists be defined with more whitespace options.  Currently,
    things like this seems to fail:
  a <- [[1]
       ]
     
 - Make a function that unloads the window but keeps running the PEBL.

- Launcher: randomize experiment chain
    -save chain to a .bat file?
    -data compiler?

 - document GetMinDist (But this is just a helper function)

- Print("") a message in test batteries about where data is saved.  Maybe link that to FileClose()?

 - add reporting for TOL of additional statistics. 
 - make a report for trails test.


- Colorblind issues in TOL, Others?

- makeImage will load a non-graphics file happily, but segfault

- seteditable() works, but .editable doesn't

-allow if() statements to be empty.  *Maybe works
-syntax _should_ handle, shouldn't it?:
}
else
{



- itemorder test uses Z/Zed; change to length 7???




- BCST: report median RTs for different response conditions
- BCST: try the Piper alternative scoring method.
