=============================================
Push to 0.13 or Later

getText seems not to work on labels

 - Let lists be defined with more whitespace options.  Currently,
    things like this seems to fail:
  a <- [[1]
       ]
     
 - Make a function that unloads the window but keeps running the PEBL.

- Launcher: randomize experiment chain
    -save chain to a .bat file?
    -data compiler?

 - document GetMinDist (But this is just a helper function)

- Print("") a message in test batteries about where data is saved.  Maybe link that to FileClose()?

 - add reporting for TOL of additional statistics. 
 - make a report for trails test.


- Colorblind issues in TOL, Others?

- makeImage will load a non-graphics file happily, but segfault

- seteditable() works, but .editable doesn't

-allow if() statements to be empty.  *Maybe works
-syntax _should_ handle, shouldn't it?:
}
else
{



- itemorder test uses Z/Zed; change to length 7???




- BCST: report median RTs for different response conditions
- BCST: try the Piper alternative scoring method.
