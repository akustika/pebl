todo:

 - add reporting for TOL of additional statistics.
 - Add a FileExists() function???
 - Add a Dir() functions???

 -automatic subject code/experiment name logging?
 - Make/document various layout functions
 - Make a function that unloads the window but keeps running the PEBL.




- Print("") a message in test batteries about where data is saved.  Maybe link that to FileClose()?


- file concatenation function (appendfile?).

- streams of experiments

- FileExists() to test whether a file is there

- WaitForAnyKeyPressForTimeout doesn't work.
