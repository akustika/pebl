todo:


* width and height parameters no longer working on lines (see shapes.pbl)
* .zoomx and .zoomy are not printed out in the printproperties #Fixed 
* .zoomx and .zoomy mess up the location of the image--it should keep
   at the same center, but it does not.  #fixed??
* Do something about quotes.        #gQuote solves this?
* writepng has arguments backward?  #reversed.
* writepng doesn't work well on objects (other than windows)
