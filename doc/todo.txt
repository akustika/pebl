update/ Document how  the last parameter of MakeFont(), if set to 0,
is now rendered smoothly using alpha transparency.  Before it was
blocky. Using this allows one to make a font label with a transparent
background.  In that case, bgcol is ignored.


-fix TOAV to work, as fixed in T3 test.

- Update versions of fonts we distribute (especially vera.ttf)
- Make gPEBLFONT point to Vera.ttf, and force all auto functions to
  use it.
