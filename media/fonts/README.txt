PEBL Fonts

Fonts in this directory are novel PEBL fonts or rdistributed with PEBL in accordance
with their original licenses. They are taken from two primary sources (Bitstream and SIL), 
have three major typeface series (Bitstream Vera; SIL Charis, Doulos, and Gentium), and 
include our onw font 'stimulasia' which currently includes directional symmetric symbols
and will continue to grow as needed.

Information about and original packaging of the Bitstream Vera fonts is avaliable at:

These fonts are distributed under the SIL open font license, reproduced in OFL.txt
Gentium fonts are designed to "allow diverse ethnic groups around the world who
use teh Latin script to produce readable, high-quality publications". Doulos SIL
provides glyphs for a wide range of Latin and Cyrillic characters.  Charis is
similar (and apparantly based upon) Bitstream Charter
