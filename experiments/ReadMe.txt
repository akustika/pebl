This directory contains various complete and semi-complete experiment scripts. 



PEBL scripts are designed to be run from a shortcut to a special front-end launcher.  
The shortcut is located in My Documents\pebl-exp.08.  Whe you run the launcher, it will
open up a launcher window with the available script files visible in the window.  To launch 
a script, select the script in the upper right box, set whatever options you want (like turn
on or off fullscreen execution), and hit "Run PEBL Script".

The script will execute, and will often produce output related to script execution or data
collection.  These will appear in the "User Output (stdout.txt)" and
the "Errors and Messages (stderr.txt)" output panels.  If a script does not produce output,
a message will display that says "Experiment complete: No output produced."  This is not an error.


A number of scripts are provided in pebl-exp.08 and pebl-exp.08/demo. Most of these are just test 
scripts for various aspects of PEBL, and so are not interesting unless you want to learn how to program
new experiments. In addition, a set of 
experiments in the PEBL Test Battery are installed in c:\Program Files\PEBL\battery.  To try one
of these out, copy its folder to My Documents\pebl-exp.08, run the launcher, and run the script from
within the launcher.  Running the script from the Prorgam Files location is not recommended as you
need to have the proper administrator access in order to save output files.

To modify or write your own scripts, look at the documentation or tutorial my the doc/ directory.  You can
open any script (.pbl file)in wordpad or notepad to change or edit.
