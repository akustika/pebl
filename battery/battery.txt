PEBL PSYCHOLOGICAL TEST BATTERY Version 0.1

Released May 2006 
Part of the PEBL Project

About:
The PEBL Psychological Test Battery is a set of psychological
tests available for the PEBL Experiment Building Language
(http://pebl.sourceforge.net).  The consist of freely usable and
modifiable versions of commonly-used psychological tests. They will
run on Microsoft Windows, OSX, or Linux operating systems.  They are
all intended to run using only visual stimuli, although the digit span
has the option to use auditory presentation as well.

For all experiments, specifying the subject number in the PEBL
launcher (or using the -s IDENTIFIER command line) will select what
the saved file should be called.  If nothing is given, the default of
0 will be used.

Tasks:

The following tests are currently available:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*                      Berg's Wisconsin Card Sorting Test 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Location: bcst/cardsort.pbl

Description:
		Our version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (tm).
		Participants sort presented cards according to an unknown and
		changing rule.

Options:
		* repeats affects how many times through the deck
		* runlength (default is 5) determines how many correct sorts are
		  needed before the rule changes.
		* useCanonical determines whether the 4 stimulus cards are the
		  same as in Berg's original, or whether they are generated randomly.

Results:
	    Data are stored in bcst-<gsubnum>.txt.  Detailed report stored
	    in bcst-report-<gsubnum>.txt.  Report calculates trials,
	    accuracy, number incorrect, perseverations on prior rule, and
	    number of achieved categories.





-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*                                  Digit Span 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: dspan/digitspan.pbl

Description:
This is a standard digit span task. It has visual/auditory
presentation of number strings, keyboard input.  Can be used directly
be the subject, or the keyboard entry can be done by a trained
experimenter using vocal recall.

Options: 
* The script will run three different versions of the task:
  starting low and go up until too many errors; starting high and
  go lower until too many corrects; and an adaptive staircase
  procedure.  These are selected by changing the gVersion variable in
  the script.

* The gUseAudio variable controls whether auditory stimuli and
  feedback should be given.

* The starting lengths, number per length, upper and lower bounds, and
  accuracy criteria are controlled by variables at the beginning of the
  file.
* The endearly variable determines whether the complete
  set of trials at each length are tested, or if the testing at each
  length continues only until the criterion has been met. 

Results:
 Basic results are output to dspan-<subnum>.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*                         Implicit Association Task
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: iat/IAT.pbl

Description: Version of the Implicit Association Task/Implicit
Attitude Test.  This version uses non-controversial stimuli of natural
kinds versus artifacts, and nouns versus verbs.  

Options:

The task can be customized by changing the header text at the
beginning of the experiment and changing the words and picture names
in picnames-good.txt, picnames-bad.txt, words-good.txt and
words-bad.txt.



Results:
Data saved to iat-<gsubnum>.txt.  A summary report is also produced,
which is saved to iat-report-<gsubnum>.txt.  This gives mean response
times and error rates for different block conditions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*                             Iowa Gambling Task
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: iowa/iowa.pbl

Description: Implementation of the Iowa Gambling task.  4 decks are
given, participant must draw cards from whatever deck they choose. Two
decks are net positive, two are net negative.

Options:  By default, the penalty cards are shuffled within 10-card
blocks.  setting shuffleDecks <- 0 will use the original order for all
participants.  Baseline rewards for each deck can be changed as well.

 
Results:
Data are written to igd-<gsubnum>.txt  Columns are:
subject_id trial deck reward penalty net total absulute_time latency


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*                         Continuous Performance Task
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: pcpt/pcpt.pbl
Description:  A continuous performance task akin to Conners' Continuous
              Performance task.  A constant series of letter stimuli
              appear on the screen; participant must respond to all
              stimuli EXCEPT the X.
Options:
              The default parameters reflect the Connors task
              faithfully.  
              * One can control things like block size, number of
                cycles through the ISIs, etc.
              * ISI values should not be adjusted freely--they need to
                be changed in several places to work properly.
              * By default, the task provides feedback in the form of
                a green + or a red -.  To eliminate feedback, set
                giveFeedback to 0.
Results:
              Detailed data is stored in pcpt-<gsubnum>.txt.  Detailed
              summary report is in pcpc-report-<gsubnum>.txt.  This
              contains a number of summary statistics broken down
              across ISI.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*                       Probabilistic Reversal Learning Test
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: probrev/probrev.pbl

Description: Task involves learning a 'rule' which determine which of
two abstract stimuli are selected.  The rule changes in the middle of
the block, and the goal is to see how quickly the participant can
adapt to the rule change.  Feedback is probabilistic

Options:
One can control the blocksize, stage size, distribution of
probabilistic errors, and substitute new images for the stimuli.

Results:
Data is saved to probrev-<gsubnum>.txt. Columns are: 
subnum block stage overall_trial block_trial pres_order valid_feedback
correct_count corr rt
 Basic report is printed to probrev-report-<gsubnum>.txt



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*                               Simple Response Time
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: srt/SimpleRT.pbl

Description: Simple reaction time task--an X stimulus appears at
delays between 250 and 2500 ms, and the participant must depress the
"X" key as quickly as possible.  

Options: Defaults to 50 trials in 4 blocks, with 10 different delay
durations. These can be changed freely.
 

Results:
Data is saved to file srt-<gsubnum>.txt.  Columns are:
subject_id block trial_in_block absolute_time delay  measured_delay rt too_fast_resp resp

A summary of the results, with means and standard deviations across
delays, is output to srt-report-<gsubnum>.txt.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*                        Test of Attentional Vigilance (TOAV)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: toav/toav.pbl

Description:
		Our implementation of the T.O.V.A. (Test of variables of
		attention).  Similar in intent to the pcpt task.  A white square
		appears briefly on the screen, with a black square within it.
		Participant must respond only to targets--the black square on
		top.  Useful index of ADHD-type conditions.

Options: No easily controlled options are available.

Results:
		Data stored in toav-<gsubnum>.txt.  Detailed report in
		toav-report-<gsubnum>.txt

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*                   Psychomotor Vigilance Task
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Location: ppvt/ppvt.pbl

Description: Simple reaction time task--an circle stimulus appears at
delays between 2 and 12 seconds, and the participant must depress the
spacebar as quickly as possible. This is basically the simple RT task,
but a version commonly used to measure sleepiness and arousal.

Options:
By editing script, one can specify aspects of the task: Number of
trials, total test duration, isis

 

Results:
Data is saved to file ppvt-<gsubnum>.txt.  Columns are:

SubjectNum, Block, Trial, ISI, absolute_Time, RT, trial_type
for trial type, 1=too fast, 2= OK, 3 = lapse (> 500 ms) 4 = sleep (>30 s)


A summary of the results, with means and standard deviations across
delays, is output to ppvt-report-<gsubnum>.txt.
